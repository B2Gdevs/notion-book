# Notification Templates

This folder contains HTML notification templates that are directly copied from [Sendgrid](https://mc.sendgrid.com/dynamic-templates). 

## Transactional Emails

We use Sendgrid to send out transactional emails. Transactional emails are automated, real-time emails that are sent to users through your app. Examples include password resets, welcome messages, order confirmations, and purchase receipts.

## Dynamic Templates

The templates we use are dynamic templates. Dynamic templates allow you to use a single email template for different use cases by dynamically changing the content for each recipient. This makes it easier to manage and update your email templates.

## Modifying Notification Templates

If you need to modify these notification templates, you will need access to Sendgrid. The access details can be found in 1Password. 

For help getting access to 1Password, please contact:

Please ensure to maintain the readability and formatting of the HTML code when making modifications.

Note: The templates in actual use are still housed in Sendgrid's systems.
