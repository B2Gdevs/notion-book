# Using React Query and Custom Hooks in Our Project

## Introduction
In our project, we have adopted React Query along with custom hooks for handling API calls. This README explains the benefits and considerations of this approach, providing insights into how it enhances our application's development and performance.

## Benefits

### 1. **Simplified Component Logic**
Custom hooks abstract away the data fetching and mutation logic from our components. This leads to cleaner components, focused more on rendering and user interaction. It simplifies maintenance and enhances readability, as components are not cluttered with data fetching logic.

### 2. **Reusable Code**
Our custom hooks are designed to be reusable across various components. This approach reduces code duplication, making our codebase more efficient and easier to maintain. Changes made in hooks propagate across all components that use them.

### 3. **Optimized Performance**
React Query optimizes performance by providing efficient caching and state management for server data. It reduces unnecessary network requests and ensures that our application remains responsive and fast.

### 4. **Consistent State Management**
With React Query, server state, caching, and background updates are managed in a consistent manner. This reduces the likelihood of bugs associated with manual state and cache management.

### 5. **Enhanced Developer Experience**
By abstracting complex logic into hooks, components become more focused and straightforward. This enhances the developer experience, particularly in large codebases where managing data can become cumbersome.

### 6. **Built-in Features**
React Query comes with features like automatic retries, refetching on window focus, pagination, and more. These features are invaluable for modern web applications and are seamlessly integrated into our hooks.

### 7. **Better Error and Loading State Handling**
React Query's hooks have built-in mechanisms for tracking loading and error states. This greatly simplifies UI handling for these states and improves user experience.

### 8. **Query Invalidation and Refetching**
React Query allows easy invalidation of queries and refetching of data. This is crucial for keeping data fresh and in sync with the server, especially in dynamic applications.

## Conclusion
By leveraging custom hooks and React Query, we aim to create a more maintainable, efficient, and performant application. This approach aligns with modern best practices in React development and ensures our application is scalable and robust.

## Caching and Key Management in React Query

One of the most powerful features of React Query is its ability to efficiently manage and cache server state. This feature is particularly useful in modern web applications where data changes frequently, and the UI needs to stay updated.

### Caching Benefits:

- **Reduced Network Requests**: React Query caches the results of your API calls, which reduces the number of requests to your server. This not only improves performance but also decreases the load on your server.
- **Automatic Refetching**: React Query automatically refetches data in the background when parameters change or when the user refocuses on the application, ensuring that the UI is always displaying the most up-to-date data.

### Ensuring Correct Key Usage:

To make the most out of React Query’s caching capabilities, it’s crucial to use the correct query keys. By wrapping React Query and the string for the key in a function, we ensure that we are always hitting the right key in the cache.

#### Code Example:

Let's take an example of a custom hook to fetch a user by ID:

```typescript
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import { getUserById } from '../api';

// Custom hook for fetching user by ID
export const useUser = (userId: string) => {
  return useQuery(['user', userId], () => getUserById(userId), {
    enabled: !!userId,
  });
};
```

In this example:
- The query key is `['user', userId]`. This ensures that each user fetched has a unique cache entry. React Query will use this key to cache and retrieve data.
- When `userId` changes, React Query will automatically refetch the data for the new user and update the cache.
- By using an array, we can easily build complex keys that depend on multiple variables.

### Conclusion:

By wrapping React Query with custom hooks and carefully managing query keys, we significantly enhance our application’s performance and user experience. This approach provides a robust mechanism for data fetching, caching, and synchronization, making our application more responsive and efficient.
